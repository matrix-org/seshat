//! Seshat - a full text search library for Matrix clients.
//!
//! There are two modes of operation for Seshat, adding live events as they
//! come in:
//!
//! ```
//! use seshat::{Database, Event, Profile};
//! use tempfile::tempdir;
//!
//! let tmpdir = tempdir().unwrap();
//! let mut database = Database::new(tmpdir.path()).unwrap();
//!
//! /// Method to call for every live event that gets received during a sync.
//! fn add_live_event(event: Event, profile: Profile, database: &Database) {
//!     database.add_event(event, profile);
//! }
//! /// Method to call on every successful sync after live events were added.
//! fn on_sync(database: &mut Database) {
//!     database.commit().unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The other mode is to add events from the room history using the
//! `/room/{room_id}/messages` Matrix API endpoint. This method supports
//! storing checkpoints which remember the arguments to continue fetching events
//! from the `/room/{room_id}/messages` API:
//!
//! ```noexecute
//! database.add_historic_events(events, old_checkpoint, new_checkpoint)?;
//! ```
//!
//! Once events have been added a search can be done:
//! ```noexecute
//! let result = database.search("test", &SearchConfig::new()).unwrap();
//! ```
